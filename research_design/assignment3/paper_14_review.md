5. Within the domain of Computer Science/Information Science
6. Strong points of the paper
7. Weak points of the paper
8. Whether the paper is realistic

## Points 1 and 2
The length of the paper (738 words) and the template were both satisfied.
Score: 100/100

## Point 3
The paper sounds stiff at times with the style of writing sounding like a presentation of many facts in a bullet-list format (see: opening).
Beyond that, the paper is well written.
Score: 90/100

## Point 4
The evaluation is presented, but perhaps could benefit from more description on why it is chosen.
Score: 100/100

## Point 5
Yes.
Score: 100/100

## Point 6
Strong points of the paper include, but are not limited to:
- Concise explanation
- Writing follows a good logic and flow

## Point 7
Weaknesses of the paper include, but are not limited to:
- Paper reads as stiff, and tone resembles a bullet-list
- Paper topic is not a new proposal

## Point 8
The paper is realistic, because it has already been established.
Score: N/A, 100/100

## Conclusion
The paper averages a score of 98/100. However, the paper is not a new proposal.
