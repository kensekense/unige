Reviewer: Tientso Ning

<b>Paper attached with comments for reference</b>

### Considerations
1. The length of the paper
2. The extent to which the template was satisfied
3. The quality of the writing
4. The quality of results evaluation
5. Within the domain of Computer Science/Information Science
6. Strong points of the paper
7. Weak points of the paper
8. Whether the paper is realistic

## Points 1 and 2
The length of the paper (855 words) and the template format were both satisfied by the paper.
Score: 100/100

## Point 3
There are slight grammatical errors in sections of the writing (see: conclusion).
The paper's tone resembles more of an article seen in Medium or a blog (see: usage of "if one uses...", usage of "He" to refer to an  attacker).
There are slight areas where further explanation of terms may be helpful.
Beyond these concerns, the quality of the writing is acceptable.
Score: 80/100

## Point 4
The results evaluation seems complete and addresses the immediate concerns outlined by the previous sections.
The paper could benefit from a more outlined/structured presentation of the course of action in results evaluation.
Score: 100/100

## Point 5
Yes.
Score: 100/100

## Point 6
Strong points of the paper include, but are not limited to:
- Straightforward and simple explanations
- Clearly outlines the goals and importance of the topic
- Presents a clear solution

- Slight grammatical/conveyance issues, hindering the credibility of the paper
- Slight gaps in the concluding section of the paper, giving the appearance of the paper missing necessary applicability.

## Point 8
Yes.
Score: 100/100

## Conclusion
The paper averages a score of 96/100. However, it is missing a References page.
