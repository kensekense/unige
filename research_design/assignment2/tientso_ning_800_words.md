### Some thoughts and ideas
- machine assisted translation rather than machine translation?
  - translation memory, terminology management, etc
  - some hybrid between the two?
- computer assisted language learning (i.e: language hero, etc)
- correct identification of when to use the passive voice?


## Headline
ten words or fewer (free of jargon)

~~"Passive-voice sentences assists in creating better machine translations."~~


## Summary
sentence overview, don't repeat headline

~~"The passive-voice provide additional information regarding the meaning of the sentence not captured by paraphrases or other loose translations. "~~

~~"Additional information regarding meaning of a sentence could be captured by passive-voice, that are not captured by paraphrases, allowing more accurate machine translations."~~

## The Purpose
motivation of your work, potential applications (in active voice if possible)

~~"With an increasingly interconnected and international world, there is an ever growing need for information to be provided in many languages in order to ensure that users are able to understand all the information that they are given."~~

## The Problem
context of the work for a non-specialist
why is this field important

~~"In addition to providing more human-generated translations while training systems, machine translation systems have been leveraging paraphrases of sentences as foreign-languages in order to provide more flexible and better translations. However, paraphrases often contain different words and are prone at times to altering the original feeling of the sentence."~~
