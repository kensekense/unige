# Adversarial Cleaning of Translation Memory
Tientso Ning

## Headline
Translation Memory is a computer-assistant tool to assist professional translators in their work.

## Summary
Due to the nature of Translation Memory software, lots of erroneous or incomplete entries need to be cleaned in order to maintain efficiency.

## The Purpose
We want to apply adversarial training to the process of cleaning translation memory, allowing for efficient unsupervised cleaning of duplicate, incomplete, and/or erroneous entries.

## The Problem
Translation Memory is considered one of the best computer-assistance tools for professional translators, and its ability to leverage the contributions of many industry professionals cannot be overlooked. Yet, translators are only able to work more efficiently and produce better translations with good, clean, Translation Memory. We want to have a simple yet effective way of cleaning Translation Memory systems.

## The Set-up
Previous studies have looked at comparing entries to machine-translated outputs in order to detect potentially spurious entries (Barbu 2016), as well as leveraging part-of-speech information directly onto the entries in question (Zwahlen 2016). However, since the likelihood of spurious entries increases with the number of entries (as well as a function of time), the data is present to leverage applying adversarial training in the format of a generator/discriminator in order to learn a model to clean the translation memory.
