# Linguistics Exam Preparation

<b> Time Estimation: 36 Hours </b>

### Format for Exam
1. Written Exam

### Considerations
1. Should expect the questions to be similar in nature to TP5
2. Should go through calculating probabilities to understand each step
3. Place more emphasize on exercises and ability to solve

# Lecture Topics

1. 100 things about Linguistics
- we can afford to just skim over this and take notes on the relevant and important information that we think is interesting
- anything else is bonus, so don't need to spend too much time here, estimated (30-45 minutes max)

2. Language Modeling
- this involves HMM, probabilities, and a lot of the exercises are going to be based off of knowing the formulas and calculating the values from these types of problems
- this is probably one of the pillars that we will be spending more time on, estimated (180-240 minutes max)

3. Dependency Parsing
- this, like the language modeling chapter, probably has the most exercises
- need to spend a lot of time on this section as well, matching the language modeling section, estimated (180-240 minutes max)

4. Semantics, Word Embeddings
- this is an important topic, and we should know it more so for our future work
- find any and all exercises for calculations, but I doubt there will be many to calculate by hand
- need to spend decent amount of time here (90-150 minutes)

5. Etc information
- anything that we can find that we can expect to be on the exam in terms of exercises or calculation should be evaluated at a later date
- estimated (60 minutes)
