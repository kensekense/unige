# Data Science Exam Preparation

<b> Time Estimation: 96 Hours </b>

### Format for Exam
1. Oral Exam
2. Two problems from list of possibles?

### Considerations
1. Be familiar with the derivations of formulas from the slides

# Topics Covered

1. PCA, Principle Component Analysis
- meat and potatoes here, prioritize on following the formula derivations, presentation on big ideas is fine

2. LDA and EM, Linear Discriminant Analysis and EM algorithm
- prioritize on visual representations along with formula derivations

3. K Means
- spend less time here, but again focus on formula derivations

4. Information Theory
- focus on presentation and big picture
- understand the derivation of the important parts outlined in notes

5. Detection Theory
- same as above
