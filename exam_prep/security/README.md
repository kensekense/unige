# Computer Security Exam Preparation

<b> Time Estimation: 48 Hours </b>

### Format for the Exam
1. Oral Exam
2. Split into three parts: Lectures, TPs, Presentations
3. 30 minutes total
4. 5 minutes of preparation

### Considerations
1. Presumably less depth on each topic
2. Questions on TPs include ALL assignments (mandatory or not)
3. Presentations are on Moodle
4. No notes allowed for preparation
