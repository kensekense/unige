# Computer Security Exam Preparation

### Format for the Exam
1. Oral Exam
2. Split into three parts: Lectures, TPs, Presentations
3. 10 minutes on each question, 30 minutes total

### Considerations
1. Presumably less depth on each topic
2. Questions on TPs include ALL assignments (mandatory or not)
3. Presentations are on Moodle
