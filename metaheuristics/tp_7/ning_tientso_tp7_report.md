In the case that the program has variable sizes, we could aim to limit the size of the program during evolution via introducing a penalty for programs that are too long, causing a trend towards preferring shorter programs. Additionally, with the program sizes being variable, we would have to alter the crossover function to use the correct lengths when referencing the respective segments, but otherwise would not have to change the implementation since the stack syntax would still hold even if the output isn't always a valid value, meaning that we can still evaluate fitness and penalize accordingly.

# Conclusion
Our algorithm was able to provide good results and optimize the program given.
